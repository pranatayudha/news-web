(1, 'Creating Scroll Animations in Flutter', '2', 'Build smooth scrolling animations from scratch with Flutter.', '<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\">Introduction</h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In this article, we&rsquo;ll look at how to create custom scroll animations from scratch using the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://flutter.dev/\">Flutter SDK</a>. Flutter is a powerful tool for creating native mobile applications that run great, and it allows an incredible amount of flexibility in creating rich user experiences (such as animations).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">If you don&rsquo;t have a Flutter environment, head over to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install\">installation page</a>. The source code for the example project in this article is available here.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\">Getting Started</h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">For this demo, I created a default Flutter project using&nbsp;<code>flutter create</code>&nbsp;and used only classes available directly within Flutter, with no dependencies added to the project. In many cases, a task (such as a custom animation) can be accomplished directly, without the need of additional libraries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The basic idea of this example app is to create a simple list view with a few items, and as the view is scrolled up or down, make a gear spin clockwise / counterclockwise in the background. We&rsquo;ll accomplish this by taking the scroll controller used for the list view and passing it to an animated background, which builds a custom widget that rotates in sync with the scroll position.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\">Application Entry Point</h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">We&rsquo;ll start with the main application file,&nbsp;<strong>lib/main.dart</strong>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"0\" src=\"https://medium.com/media/00ddc0c95fd3eab730f018b9b70acd6f\" title=\"Main app entry file for Flutter custom scroll demo\" width=\"0\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In the&nbsp;<strong>main.dart</strong>&nbsp;file, there are imports for the following components:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>demo-card.dart&nbsp;</strong><em>(builds a Card widget from an Item)</em></li>\r\n	<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>items.dart</strong>&nbsp;<em>(defines Item class and mock content for demo app)</em></li>\r\n	<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>animated-bg.dart</strong>&nbsp;<em>(builds the animated background widget)</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The main app class (<strong>AnimationDemo</strong>) sets up a basic app that wraps the default home page widget (<strong>MyHomePage</strong>). Within the&nbsp;<strong>MyHomePage</strong>&nbsp;class there is a&nbsp;<em>_controller</em>&nbsp;property, which is initialized to a new instance of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/ScrollController-class.html\"><strong>ScrollController</strong></a>&nbsp;class to later be passed into both the&nbsp;<strong>AnimatedBackground</strong>&nbsp;(which drives the gear rotation animation in the background) and the&nbsp;<strong>ListView&nbsp;</strong>(which renders the scrolling list of demo items). There is also a&nbsp;<em>_cards</em>&nbsp;property which begins with the list of&nbsp;<strong>Item</strong>objects imported from&nbsp;<em>items.dart</em>&nbsp;and returns a list of&nbsp;<strong>DemoCard</strong>&nbsp;widgets to render in the ListView.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\">The Item Class</h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The first imported file we&rsquo;ll check out is&nbsp;<strong>lib/items.dart</strong>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"0\" src=\"https://medium.com/media/f3bc7a619da2b3b9169763107fb34e8c\" title=\"Item class and items definition in Flutter custom scroll project\" width=\"0\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The&nbsp;<strong>Item</strong>&nbsp;class provides a data structure that will be passed along to instances of&nbsp;<strong>DemoCard</strong>&nbsp;to be rendered in the&nbsp;<strong>ListView</strong>. There&rsquo;s not much to it other than the name, description (which is currently unused in the demo), color, and the&nbsp;<strong>Icon</strong>&nbsp;to render for each item. A list of&nbsp;<strong>Item</strong>&nbsp;objects will serve as a list of simple content to render within the&nbsp;<strong>ListView</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\">The DemoCard Class</h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The next file up for inspection is&nbsp;<strong>lib/demo-card.dart</strong>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"0\" src=\"https://medium.com/media/4ead6384dbed6c792940e9a064a595d5\" title=\"DemoCard class for rendering content in the Flutter scroll demo project\" width=\"0\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The&nbsp;<strong>DemoCard</strong>&nbsp;class receives an&nbsp;<strong>Item</strong>&nbsp;in its constructor and returns a Card widget that renders&nbsp;<strong>Text</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Icon</strong>&nbsp;elements that display the&nbsp;<em>name</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>icon&nbsp;</em>defined for each item. Some basic styling is applied using&nbsp;<strong>Shadow</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>TextStyle</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>RoundedRectangleBorder</strong>, along with the card&rsquo;s elevation (set to&nbsp;<code>3</code>).&nbsp;<strong>Column</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Row</strong>&nbsp;widgets are used to span child elements across the card.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\">The AnimatedBackground Class</h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Saving the best for last, let&rsquo;s check out&nbsp;<strong>lib/animated-bg.dart</strong>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"0\" src=\"https://medium.com/media/114f9c1258889063df050531bd5df075\" title=\"AnimatedBackground class for the Flutter scrolling animation demo\" width=\"0\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">At the top of the file, the&nbsp;<code>dart:math</code>&nbsp;library is imported to gain access to the&nbsp;<strong>&pi;</strong>&nbsp;constant for doing the rotational transform calculation for the spinning gear. The&nbsp;<strong>AnimatedBackground</strong>&nbsp;class constructor takes the&nbsp;<strong>ScrollController</strong>&nbsp;that will drive the rotation. The&nbsp;<em>_offset</em>&nbsp;property will return either the controller offset if the controller has clients&nbsp;<em>(i.e. the controller is properly initialized and hooked up to an actual scrolling element like the ListView)&nbsp;</em>or it will simply return zero. The&nbsp;<em>build</em>&nbsp;method returns an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/AnimatedBuilder-class.html\"><strong>AnimatedBuilder</strong></a>&nbsp;that takes the controller (which is used as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/Listenable-class.html\"><strong>Listenable</strong></a>&nbsp;to re-draw itself on scroll events) and builds an&nbsp;<strong>OverflowBox</strong>&nbsp;that is aligned to place the gear just off-screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The values&nbsp;<code>4</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>3</code>&nbsp;place the gear in the bottom-left corner of the tested device, the iPhone X? simulator. In practice, the&nbsp;<strong>Alignment</strong>&nbsp;values should be calculated from device screen height and width, to give precise values that will place the gear in the desired location (bottom-left corner, centered off to the side, etc) on any device, but for this example we&rsquo;ll keep it simple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Last up is the good part, where the animation itself takes place, within the&nbsp;<em>rotate</em>&nbsp;static method of the&nbsp;<strong>Transform</strong>&nbsp;class. This class takes an&nbsp;<code>angle</code>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<code>child</code>, and rotates the child by the angle as expected. For this demo, I wanted the gear to move slowly and feel more in mesh with the scroll physics instead of the crazy freewheel effect that it had with a 1:1 value, and I wanted the gear to scroll counter-clockwise as though it were physically driving the list, so I multipled the&nbsp;<code>offset</code>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<code>math.pi</code>&nbsp;and then divided that product by&nbsp;<em>-1024</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">This article and example project demonstrate just some of the capabilities that Flutter provides for creating custom animated user experiences. Using only a few basic classes and simple math, we have a complete animation that adds a much more interesting element to something boring (like a settings screen).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">These concepts can be extended to create splash screens, loading animations, page transitions, notification effects, or anything else imaginable. Nearly anything that takes a&nbsp;<code>double</code>&nbsp;as an argument can be animated, which leads to straightforward implementation of effects such as the rotation employed in this example, along with opacity, position, and many other properties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Thanks for reading and good luck with your next Flutter project!</p>\r\n', 'Yudha', 1577714652, 1577714652, 58, 14, '93e1bc373f86d1f8f8f07f44cc8a48bb.gif'),
(2, 'Android flavours: white-labeling an app', '2', 'White-label apps can be a good outcome when you can sell ', '<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>White-label apps can be a good outcome when you can sell a certain concept to multiple companies, and only need to adjust some minor things before shipping for a new client. Apart from that it can also come in handy when you have different versions of your app while the main functionality remains the same. A white-label project means you develop your main app once and make different flavours of that app for each version. That way you can rapidly develop the app, move quickly when a new client comes in, and fix stuff fast when bugs appear.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">So what if we have this amazing idea, and it applies to multiple companies? Or what if we need different versions of an app, but they share most of the core functionality? We can simply create our project as we normally do, but can take some stuff into account straight from the beginning. Already have a solid app and want to white-label that? No worries, the same stuff applies to you!</p>\r\n\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align:justify\">Product flavours</h1>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>You might&rsquo;ve used them before: product flavours in your Gradle file. They&rsquo;re good for setting up multiple environments for example: staging, production, etc. They&rsquo;re super handy for setting up multiple flavours as well!</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Let&rsquo;s have a short look into how the setup will look like. We can create our app like we normally would. All the core functionality will go into the main part of our app. When we run a build, this is what&rsquo;s going to be used in every case, regardless of the flavour. Everything that we specifically define for a flavour will then be used and will even override something when it&rsquo;s also defined in our main part. This can mean variables in our Gradle file, resources like app icons &amp; colors or even layouts and classes!</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/30/1*zD4HtNVpnvYPEevzFrNqbg.png?q=20\" style=\"height:275px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*zD4HtNVpnvYPEevzFrNqbg.png\" style=\"height:275px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Basic structure of a white-label app</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Now that we cleared up the setup, let&rsquo;s dive into our project. Let&rsquo;s assume we have this amazing idea for fastfood restaurants and have 2 clients that are interested: Burger Queen &amp; McMickeys. We&rsquo;ll firstly head over to our&nbsp;<code>build.gradle</code>&nbsp;file and start out by defining our product flavours:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"0\" src=\"https://medium.com/media/37a5f683003cf1855e544c72aecd2c18\" title=\"build.gradle\" width=\"0\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">As you can see, we start out by defining a&nbsp;<code>flavorDimension</code>&nbsp;called&nbsp;<code>app</code>. This is basically a group of product flavours, and can give us the ability to either refer to this group later or combine groups when making a build. The latter can come in handy when we also want to define different environments like staging and production at a later stage. For now we&rsquo;ll just add the&nbsp;<code>productFlavors</code>&nbsp;for each client and assign them to the&nbsp;<code>app</code>&nbsp;dimension.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Now that we defined our client&rsquo;s product flavours, we can add variables to each or them. Fields that would normally go into the&nbsp;<code>defaultConfig</code>&nbsp;can now be declared separately for each flavour, this can go from application id&rsquo;s to minimum SDK versions. Next to that it can also come in handy when you want to define different API base url&rsquo;s or API keys for each client for example.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"0\" src=\"https://medium.com/media/5abe5de20494197485a11658cc64ea54\" title=\"build.gradle\" width=\"0\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Go ahead and do a project sync now, you probably got notified of it already when changing the Gradle file. If not, find the sync icon next to the stop button at the top, or simply&nbsp;<code>Command/Shift/A</code>&nbsp;and look for&nbsp;<em>Sync Project with Gradle files</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/30/1*20vcAiiF7j3GnAeWZg1-ZQ.png?q=20\" style=\"height:232px; width:322px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/322/1*20vcAiiF7j3GnAeWZg1-ZQ.png\" style=\"height:232px; width:322px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Build variants, left-bottom of AS</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">After syncing, check your build variants (you can find them on the left-bottom of Android Studio) and voila! Next to the default&nbsp;<code>debug</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>release</code>variants we now have combinations with our client flavours and can run builds for each of our clients!</p>\r\n\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align:justify\">Separating resources and classes</h1>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Since we don&rsquo;t want to end up with&nbsp;<code>if/else</code>&nbsp;statements throughout our code to check on the current flavour, we&rsquo;ll separate everything in our project structure. If you haven&rsquo;t done so, make sure to switch to&nbsp;<code>project</code>above your project files to get into the project structure. What we&rsquo;re looking for is our&nbsp;<code>main</code>&nbsp;directory, which can be found in the&nbsp;<code>app/src</code>&nbsp;folder. Like we discussed a little while ago, the&nbsp;<code>main</code>&nbsp;directory will contain the core of your app, everything that can be shared throughout the product flavours. What we can do now, is create separate directories next to the&nbsp;<code>main</code>&nbsp;folder for our flavours in&nbsp;<code>app/src</code>. Everything that is specific to the client can then be put in that directory and will be used or even override resources or classes we take from&nbsp;<code>main</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/30/1*6j8MVrE0NICR-n9RJNP6Lw.png?q=20\" style=\"height:336px; width:563px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/563/1*6j8MVrE0NICR-n9RJNP6Lw.png\" style=\"height:336px; width:563px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">If you&rsquo;d like to add something to the client folder now, you can just go ahead and use it just as you&rsquo;d use&nbsp;<code>main</code>, right click and add resources or classes. If you want to override something from&nbsp;<code>main</code>, then make sure to keep naming consistent!</p>\r\n\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align:justify\">But I really want to if/else ????</h1>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">If you really can&rsquo;t withstand or really need to use a check in your code, you can simply check&nbsp;<code>BuildConfig.FLAVOR</code>&nbsp;to get the current flavour of the build. I definitely don&rsquo;t advise you to do it like this, but a very simple example would be:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"0\" src=\"https://medium.com/media/6ea4caef20c287739231739f37f3ec72\" title=\"FlavourCheck.kt\" width=\"0\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">You&rsquo;d more likely end up with a&nbsp;<code>when</code>&nbsp;clause later, rather than using&nbsp;<code>if/else</code>, but I think it&rsquo;s clear how we can check for flavours within code now ????</p>\r\n\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align:justify\">Signing different flavours</h1>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Although we live in a time where Google can take care of signing your app, we still encounter cases where we need to do it ourselves. In such cases, how do we manage to sign multiple flavours? Simply define the&nbsp;<code>signingConfigs</code>&nbsp;in your app&rsquo;s Gradle file first and make sure to add each flavour there:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"0\" src=\"https://medium.com/media/b846f2437c1d3b9c9de216d01703ee1e\" title=\"build.gradle (signing)\" width=\"0\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Now we can add the signing configuration in each flavour by adding it like so:&nbsp;<code>signingConfig signingConfigs.burgerqueen</code></p>\r\n\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align:justify\">Combining multiple flavours</h1>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Let&rsquo;s take it one step further now and add another flavour dimension for staging/production environments:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"0\" src=\"https://medium.com/media/ae2085780949b85a3f3d01775f8eebfd\" title=\"(flavours)build.gradle\" width=\"0\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">What if we have different base url&rsquo;s for both the flavours and the environments? We can define them by using key-value pairs within our flavours and then looping through all the variants to set the correct fields:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"0\" src=\"https://medium.com/media/ea45631287a60e2e3b37a8b564a61e0d\" title=\"(combineFlavours)build.gradle\" width=\"0\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">As you can see, we use the&nbsp;<code>app</code>&nbsp;flavours as keys for the url&rsquo;s within the&nbsp;<code>environment</code>&nbsp;flavours. We then loop through the&nbsp;<code>applicationVariants</code>&nbsp;and grab the correct base url by using the corresponding flavour key. That&rsquo;s basically it! Calling&nbsp;<code>BuildConfig.BASE_URL</code>&nbsp;will now get you either a staging or production base url based on the client flavour ????</p>\r\n', 'Yudha', 1577714753, 1577714753, 51, 14, '5fea6c0732c00c2439cae71b03e85151.jpeg');

It&rsquo;s a search algorithm which means it is used to find things like a number in an integer array or an item in a catalog.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe easiest way to implement a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2017/04/recursive-binary-search-algorithm-in-java-example.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">binary search algorithm</a>&nbsp;is by using Recursion, which is what the solution link contains but you should try it yourself before seeing the solution.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nOne of the worth noting this is that the input must be sorted, I mean you can only implement binary search in a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.java67.com/2014/12/how-to-find-missing-number-in-sorted.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sorted array</a>.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>2.

(</strong><a href=\"http://www.java67.com/2016/10/how-to-implement-linear-search-in-java.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>solution</strong></a><strong>)</strong><br />\r\nIt is even easier than binary search, all you need to do is go through all elements in the array using a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2015/08/java-8-journey-of-for-loop-in-java.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">for loop</a>&nbsp;or recursive method and compare each element with the one you want to search. when an element matches you either return index or&nbsp;<code>true/false</code>&nbsp;depending upon your requirement.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nFor example, if you are writing a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.java67.com/2015/09/how-to-check-if-key-exits-in-hashmap-in-java.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">contains() method</a>&nbsp;you can return&nbsp;<code>true&nbsp;</code>or&nbsp;<code>false&nbsp;</code>to indicate whether an element is present in the array or not. Since you need to scan the whole array to find the element, the time complexity of this algorithm is&nbsp;<code>O(n)</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Btw, if you have trouble calculating and understanding time and space complexity of algorithms then you should see a course like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Flearn-data-structure-algorithms-with-java-interview%2F\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Data Structures &amp; Algorithms?&mdash;?Interview</strong></a>&nbsp;to understand them better before going for an interview.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>3.

I haven&rsquo;t come across any practical use case of this one yet but just knowing the concept is Ok from the interview perspective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a stable sorting algorithm, the order of the same element remains the same even after sorting but during the unstable sorting algorithm, this changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A good example is a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.java67.com/2014/07/quicksort-algorithm-in-java-in-place-example.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">quicksort</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.java67.com/2018/03/mergesort-in-java-algorithm-example-and.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">mergesort&nbsp;</a>where former is unstable while later is a stable algorithm.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>7. What is Depth First Search Algorithm for a binary tree? (solution)</strong><br />\r\nIt&rsquo;s another popular searching algorithm which is mainly used in tree and graphs. This algorithm first visits nodes in depth before searching in the same level, that&rsquo;s why the name Depth-first search algorithm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s tricky to implement but you can use a Stack to implement DFS or Depth-first search algorithm.

If you remember, I have told you before that you can use a Stack to convert a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2012/12/recursion-in-java-with-example-programming.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">recursive algorithm</a>&nbsp;into an iterative one and that&rsquo;s what you can do as well to implement Quicksort algorithm without recursion.

There is another trick, check for all the conditions when rectangle will not overlap and if any condition is false it means both rectangles are overlapping with each other. For example, if the upper side of one rectangle is below the lower side of other rectangles then they won&rsquo;t overlap as they are vertically aligned.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>14.

This means equal elements retain their spot before and after sorting.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nAnother worth noting difference is that even though both have&nbsp;<code>O(NLogN)</code>average time, it&rsquo;s better to use quicksort than mergesort because Quicksort takes less time for the same number of input, the constant factor is less in Quicksort than merge sort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><a href=\"https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/04/top-20-searching-and-sorting-algorithms-interview-questions.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*zeqtqLdrVXEHwHzd.png\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>15.

Aspiring developers often doubt themselves at some point, and experienced engineers might suffer from the&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;</strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Impostor Syndrome</strong></a><strong>&rdquo;</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In this post, I will share some tips on how you can badge the title &ldquo;excellent engineer&rdquo; from managers. I will also highlight some day-to-day coding habits to help you achieve this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Before you read further, I want to be able to make you think differently about yourself. Purge yourself of negative mindset like,&nbsp;<em>excellence is not for me</em>,&nbsp;<em>I don&rsquo;t have natural talents and potentials</em>. This is not true. You can learn new things, you are better at something, you can improve the skills you already have. Picture yourself living in a global world. No one will see you as a global software engineer if you don&rsquo;t present yourself as one. It all begins with how you think of yourself. There are some habits you may need to unlearn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Like Edmond Mbiaka said, &ldquo;Take positive care of your mind, and it will surely take positive care of your life.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">As a mentor in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.microverse.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Microverse program,</a>&nbsp;I frequently share my thoughts with my mentees. These are my words to them;</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Successful software engineers:</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style=\"text-align:justify\">set definite goals, and</li>\r\n	<li style=\"text-align:justify\">choose excellent day-to-day habits</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>&ldquo;To be successful is to achieve an intended goal. Where there is no goal, there can be no success</strong>&rdquo;. Yes! You work so hard, and so smart but can you engage the force of excellence to achieve your desired goal (success).?&nbsp;<strong>Excellence is a lifestyle, not an event. It is an undeniable distinguishing factor in life.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Oftentimes you want to get one thing done, move to the next, and the next, and the next. But, remember no employer will recruit a loose developer irrespective their talents. Adopting a culture of excellence in your daily development activities will make you consider:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style=\"text-align:justify\">creating clean commit messages</li>\r\n	<li style=\"text-align:justify\">writing tests to check your code performance and output, instead of making &ldquo;<strong>code assumptions</strong>&rdquo;</li>\r\n	<li style=\"text-align:justify\">using pull requests to improve your code</li>\r\n	<li style=\"text-align:justify\">managing details when creating models, UI/UX in a manner that is beyond the usual</li>\r\n	<li style=\"text-align:justify\">adopting standards</li>\r\n	<li style=\"text-align:justify\">tracking how you spend your time</li>\r\n	<li style=\"text-align:justify\">asking questions to gain clarity and reduce loop-back consequences</li>\r\n	<li style=\"text-align:justify\">taking short breaks as often as you can</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a great programmer; I&rsquo;m just a good programmer with great habits.&rdquo; ?&nbsp;<strong>Kent Beck</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align:justify\">Here are six cornerstone habits that will help you achieve excellence and make you a globally competitive software engineer.</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>1. Be intentional and deliberate</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">You should make a decision about the height you want to meet in your career and be intentional about it. Take your career a little more seriously, don&rsquo;t just sit idle waiting for someone to ask you to join their team. &ldquo;<strong>A lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on another&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Get to work, get a degree, get training, start somewhere! Excellence is execution tempered with discipline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">For me, I believe this is the first place to begin. If you have set some goals for yourself, then its time to move on to the next step.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Again, be deliberate about the next few things I will mention below.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>2. Evaluate your process(es)</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Measure twice, cut once. Think twice, code once.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&ldquo;A programmer does not primarily write code; rather, he primarily writes to another programmer about his problem solution. The understanding of this fact is the final step in his maturation as an engineer&rdquo;. (Anonymous)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Ask yourself some important questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style=\"text-align:justify\">Do you have a process to get things done? How does it help you to achieve the desired excellence?</li>\r\n	<li style=\"text-align:justify\">Do you know about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Gitflow Workflow</strong></a>?</li>\r\n	<li style=\"text-align:justify\">How meaningful are your git-commit messages?</li>\r\n	<li style=\"text-align:justify\">How often do you weigh readability and clean design when naming your variables?</li>\r\n	<li style=\"text-align:justify\">Do you create PRs (Pull Requests) so that someone more competent than you can give a code review?</li>\r\n	<li style=\"text-align:justify\">How much attention do you give to details?</li>\r\n	<li style=\"text-align:justify\">Is code refactoring part of your day-to-day coding habits?</li>\r\n	<li style=\"text-align:justify\">Do you create documentation for each feature you implement?</li>\r\n	<li style=\"text-align:justify\">How often does your process benchmark performance while writing your code?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Asking yourself mattering questions will guide you in building excellent habits. These habits will mould your strengths before hiring managers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>3. Exposure and observation is important</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Exposure expands your mind, and lack of it can pose a limitation to you. Read about, learn from and associate with people more experienced. Ask smart questions that infer that you crave to grow better. &ldquo;Questions are the important thing, answers are less important. Learning to ask a good question is the heart of intelligence.&rdquo; Assumption can sometimes be the lowest level of knowledge. Steer clear of it, ensure that you hold a clear understanding of what to do, and how to do it. Some concepts are difficult to understand, but with practice, they become part of you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">You also learn when you visit different cities, attend conferences and meetups. There are more online webinars, Lunch &amp; Learn and training you can attend to expand your mind. I would recommend the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.microverse.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Microverse&nbsp;</a>program if you are looking to start your journey as a software engineer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Connect with experienced senior engineers, discover their strategies, observe their style of coding, work ethics, and problem-solving approach. Take advantage of professional social media like LinkedIn. I quite agree with some hiring managers who are of the opinion that &ldquo;LinkedIn has become a single source of truth for finding professionals.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Next&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>4. Give your task all it takes, gain the required knowledge</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Don&rsquo;t jump steps. If you start a task, stick to it until you finish it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&ldquo;<strong>Without requirements or design, programming is the art of adding bugs to an empty text file.</strong>&rdquo; (Louis Srygley)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">A couple of times you want to reply that tweet, watch YouTube videos, read that medium post, Yes! these are great of course. However, practising with a simple notepad to record ideas that cross your mind will help you maintain focus. Practice time tracking techniques with tools like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.marinaratimer.com/p8Hq6DQy\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Pomodoro</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://clockify.me/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Clockify</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&ldquo;Coding requires 1% effort, staying focused on coding requires 99% effort.&rdquo; Maintaining focus requires deliberate action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Every good problem solver must show great patience in order to get the problem solved. This is a rare quality in software developers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Next...</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>5. Adopt standards and follow them&nbsp;strictly</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Most times, when you learn a new language you begin to code in a particular style that you want. However, when you start working on smaller parts of a big application, your style could introduce conflicts and discredit your capacity to work in a team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Software development teams adopt globally accepted standards and will contribute to improving them. Your ability to follow standards will distinguish surely you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Learn about general coding standards, language-specific standards, design principles and stick to them.&nbsp;<strong>Standards help you write quality code?&mdash;?easy to maintain and debug.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">You should:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li style=\"text-align:justify\">find the best practices for tracking your code performance</li>\r\n	<li style=\"text-align:justify\">follow best practices in design patterns for back-end or front-end development</li>\r\n	<li style=\"text-align:justify\">follow software development methods</li>\r\n	<li style=\"text-align:justify\">practice test-driven development</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&ldquo;Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.&rdquo;<strong>?</strong>&mdash;?Harold Abelson</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>6. Understand the law of&nbsp;value</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&ldquo;VALUE&nbsp;PEOPLE.&rdquo; People will naturally value you if you offer them value. Learn to show empathy towards people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Incrementally add value to yourself, improve your communication skills, learn a foreign language, practice public speaking, buy a new pet (if you love pets), visit your family and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">On the other hand, value your employer, code reviewer, senior engineers, line manager plus other team members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In conclusion, I have highlighted strategies that can help aspiring engineers develop excellent habits</p>\r\n', 'Yudha', 1577714952, 1577714952, 50, 14, '40738f945c9a0614f0625843f22fd214.jpeg');

Hansson and made big noise in the developer&rsquo;s community due to its unique Model-View-Controller principle. For three years, from 2006 to 2009, the industry demand for Ruby on Rails peaked, and for quite a while it was regarded as a top-rated framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After several years,<em>&nbsp;</em><strong><em>stability has replaced RoR&rsquo;s popularity</em></strong><em>.&nbsp;</em>The relevance and popularity of RoR doesn&rsquo;t swing like a rollercoaster?&mdash;?its stability means that it is well-tested and safe to use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But once Rails stopped appearing in top charts, it was thought of as &ldquo;dead.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>This makes me wonder&nbsp;: is popularity a proper measurement of existence?</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>2<strong>Becoming outdated:&nbsp;</strong>Rails is one of the &lsquo;oldies&rsquo; in the world of development. It has been almost 15 years since Ruby on Rails and its MVC principle appeared on the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, the market is dominated by AI, ML, and data science. They are the &lsquo;hype&rsquo; technologies that programming languages and frameworks are eager to use.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sloboda-studio.com/blog/ruby-vs-python-which-one-to-choose/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Comparing Rails to Python</em></a><em>, RoR does not have enough functionality to build AI-based projects</em>, this framework is sometimes considered to be obsolete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3<strong>New frameworks:&nbsp;</strong>Since the first Rails release, hundreds of other programming languages, frameworks, and updates have appeared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is clear that competition is continuing to rise, and people tend to talk about up-and-coming technologies.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Why ruby on rails is&nbsp;alive?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, as each technogy&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sloboda-studio.com/blog/pros-and-cons-of-ruby-on-rails/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Rails framework has its own pros and cons.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let me jump right to the&nbsp;<strong>evidence of RoR&rsquo;s well-being:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.<strong>Practicality:&nbsp;</strong>Ruby on Rails is convenient, functional, and?&mdash;?most importantly?&mdash;?practical. It offers developers many helpful&nbsp;<strong><em>libraries</em></strong>, otherwise known as<em>&nbsp;</em><strong><em>&lsquo;gems&rsquo;</em></strong>, and tools that make the development process faster and more readable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.<strong>Community:&nbsp;</strong>The beauty of RoR is its&nbsp;<strong><em>ongoing evolution</em></strong>. More and more developers choose Rails as their preferred programming language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to learn something new, find solutions to their aching problems, or discover some cool &lsquo;gems&rsquo; created by senior mentors, they turn to the community of other RoR users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.<strong>Usage by corporations:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*pNNolp3FMfIRcdCd96XqxQ.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no need to explain further. As you can see,&nbsp;<strong><em>big companies use Ruby on Rails</em></strong>&nbsp;due to its convenience and readable syntax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you start using Rails, it quickly grows on you. Major companies stay loyal to Rails because it was likely their framework of choice when they started as small companies with unknown names. It didn&rsquo;t fail them then, and it won&rsquo;t fail them now.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The future of Ruby on&nbsp;Rails</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>However, a new version of Rails was released in April 2019,&nbsp;<strong><em>a new release of Ruby 3</em></strong>&nbsp;is on its way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Ruby improvement will directly influence Rails with the addition of some new features and speed improvements. The user community and Rails developers can&rsquo;t wait to use these updates in new versions of their framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Ruby release is planned for 2020 and includes three main goals:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol style=\"margin-left:40px\">\r\n	<li>Static Analysis</li>\r\n	<li>JIT / Ruby 3&times;3 / Performance</li>\r\n	<li>Concurrency</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><strong>In a nutshell,&nbsp;</strong>Ruby on Rails is a well-established Ruby framework that is not planning to disappear without a fight.

Here if I want my computer to identify that the picture is of a cat or not. Then let&rsquo;s take a look at how this thing will work:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>I will take a huge number of images in which there are many cats in different positions, the different breeds, in different colors, in different situations, etc.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Then I will define the characteristics of a cat. Like how basically it looks, it&rsquo;s eye shape, it&rsquo;s average height and what is its functions and all of those things.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Then I will choose the machine learning model which I want to apply on data to gain results.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>In these final steps, I will put that data on that machine learning model to get the final answer.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>So now after applying all those steps, my computer is ready to identify whether it is an image of a cat or not. So now you may have understood how complex process it is. This is just applicable for a cat, just imagine how many objects, situations, and things are there in the real world.

(8, 'What Is Zero UI? (And Why Is It Crucial To The Future Of Design?)', '5', 'What does UI design look like after screens go away? Fjord’s Andy Goodman explains.', '<p>For better or worse, a large amount of design work these days is visual. That makes sense, since the most essential products we interact with have screens. But as the internet of things surrounds us with devices that can hear our words, anticipate our needs, and sense our gestures, what does that mean for the future of design, especially as those screens go away?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last week at San Francisco&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"http://solidcon.com/internet-of-things-2015\" target=\"_blank\">SOLID Conference</a>, Andy Goodman, group director of Fjord, shared his thoughts on what he thinks the new paradigm of design will be like when our interfaces are no longer constrained by screens, and instead turn to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fastcodesign.com/3043795/why-we-need-a-haptic-design-language-for-wearables\" target=\"_self\">haptic</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fastcodesign.com/3047199/apple-finally-learns-ai-is-the-new-ui\" target=\"_self\">automated</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fastcodesign.com/3043132/meet-henri-a-box-for-designing-the-screenless-interfaces-of-tomorrow\" target=\"_self\">ambient</a>&nbsp;interfaces. He calls it Zero UI. We talked to him about what it meant.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"What_Is_Zero_UI\">WHAT IS ZERO UI?</a></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Zero UI isn&rsquo;t really a new idea. If you&rsquo;ve ever used an Amazon Echo, changed a channel by waving at a Microsoft Kinect, or setup a Nest thermostat, you&rsquo;ve already used a device that could be considered part of Goodman&rsquo;s Zero UI thinking. It&rsquo;s all about getting away from the touchscreen, and interfacing with the devices around us in more natural ways: haptics, computer vision, voice control, and artificial intelligence. Zero UI is the design component of all these technologies, as they pertain to what we call the internet of things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto/fc/3048139-inline-i-1-what-is-zero-ui.jpg\" style=\"height:970px; width:970px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;If you look at the history of computing, starting with the jacquard loom in 1801, humans have always had to interact with machines in a really abstract, complex way,&rdquo; Goodman says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over time, these methods have become less complex: the punch card gave way to machine code, machine code to the command line, command line to the GUI. But machines still force us to come to them on&nbsp;<em>their</em>&nbsp;terms, speaking&nbsp;<em>their</em>&nbsp;language. The next step is for machines to finally understand us on our own terms, in our own natural words, behaviors, and gestures. That&rsquo;s what Zero UI is all about.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"How_Will_Zero_UI_Change_Design\">HOW WILL ZERO UI CHANGE DESIGN?</a></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Goodman, Zero UI represents a whole new dimension for designers to wrestle with. Literally. He likens the designer&rsquo;s leap from UI to Zero UI as similar to what happens in the novella&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fastcodesign.com/3045202/wanted/the-classic-novella-iflatland-i-finally-gets-the-design-makeover-it-deserves\" target=\"_self\"><em>Flatland</em></a>: instead of just designing for two-dimensions&ndash;i.e. what a user is trying to do right now in a linear, predictable workflow&ndash;designers need to think about what a user is trying to do right now in&nbsp;<em>any</em>&nbsp;possible workflow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto/fc/3048139-inline-i-2-what-is-zero-ui.jpg\" style=\"height:800px; width:800px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take voice control, for instance. Right now, voice control through something like Amazon Echo or Siri is relatively simple: a user asks a question (&ldquo;Who was the 4th president of the United States?&rdquo;) or makes a statement (&ldquo;Call my husband&rdquo;) and the device acts upon that single request. But ask Siri to &ldquo;Message my husband the 4th president of the United States, then tell me who the fifth is?&rdquo; and it&rsquo;ll barf all over itself. To build services and devices that can translate a stream-of-consciousness command like that, designers will need to think non-linearly. They&rsquo;ll need to be able to build a system capable of adjusting to anything on the fly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like learning to play 3-D chess,&rdquo; Goodman laughs. &ldquo;We need to think away from linear workflows, and towards multi-dimensional thought process.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"Zero_UI_Will_Require_Designers_To_Rely_On_Data_And_AI\">ZERO UI WILL REQUIRE DESIGNERS TO RELY ON DATA AND AI</a></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Whereas interface designers right now live in apps like InDesign and Adobe Illustrator, the non-linear design problems of zero UI will require vastly different tools, and skill sets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We might have to design in databases, or lookup tables, or spreadsheets,&rdquo; Goodman says, explaining that data, not intuition, will become a designer&rsquo;s most valuable asset. &ldquo;Designers will have to become experts in science, biology, and psychology to create these devices&hellip; stuff we don&rsquo;t have to think about when our designs are constrained by screens.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto/fc/3048139-inline-i-3-what-is-zero-ui.jpg\" style=\"height:929px; width:929px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, let&rsquo;s say you have a television that can sense gestures. Depending on who is standing in front of that TV, the gestures it needs to understand to do something as simple as turn up the volume might be radically different: a 40-year-old who grew up in the age of analog interfaces might twist an imaginary dial in mid-air, while a millennial might jerk their thumb up. A zero UI stereo will need to have access to a lot of behavioral data, let alone the processing power to decode them.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;As we move away from screens, a lot of our interfaces will have to become more automatic, anticipatory, and predictive,&rdquo; Goodman says. A good example of this sort of device, Goodman says, is the Nest: you set its thermostat once, and then it learns to anticipate what you want based on how you interact with it from there.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><a name=\"Whats_After_Zero_UI\">WHAT&rsquo;S AFTER ZERO UI?</a></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Although Goodman is serious about the fact that screens are going to stop being the primary way we interact with the devices around us, he&rsquo;s the first to admit that the Zero UI name isn&rsquo;t meant to be taken literally. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really meant to be a provocation,&rdquo; Goodman admits. &ldquo;There are always going to be user interfaces in some form of another, but this is about getting away from thinking about everything in terms of screens.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But if Goodman&rsquo;s right, and the entire history of computing is less a progression of mere technological advancements, and more a progression of advancements in the way we are able to communicate with machines, then what happens after we achieve Zero UI? What happens when our devices finally understand us better than we understand ourselves? Is anything we want to do with an app, gadget, or device is just a shrug, a grunt, or a caress away?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really into all that singularity stuff,&rdquo; Goodman laughs. &ldquo;Once you get to the point that computers understand us, the next step is that computers get embedded in us, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fastcodesign.com/1671960/why-the-human-body-will-be-the-next-computer-interface\" target=\"_self\">we become the next UI</a>.&rdquo;</p>\r\n', 'Yudha', 1577715318, 1577715318, 53, 15, '5982fca1686175e68d5a34677f8db73f.jpg');

For example, these segments might include people who started a trial but didn&rsquo;t buy, people who started a trial and bought, etc. Once we&rsquo;ve defined the segments, we look at behavior based on events created in&nbsp;<a href=\"http://kissmetrics.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">KISSMetrics</a>.</li>\r\n	<li>For qualitative data, we interview ~30 users total from all segments to try to understand the &ldquo;why&rdquo; behind the data.</li>\r\n	<li>Based on quantitative data and interviews, we can start plotting out patterns that eventually form our user personas.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-09-03 at 09.40.45\" src=\"https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-03-at-09.40.45-520x472.png\" style=\"height:472px; width:520px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Photo credit:&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://www.uxpin.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>UXPin</em></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You need to create things people want. Step back and evaluate every website or app you frequent. Do you feel like you are part of the design? Is it personal? It is intuitive and easy? That&rsquo;s human.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><strong>2. Design for Comfort and Predictability</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a few elements in the design process that you just can&rsquo;t change, like device type and screen size. But you can affect how things render and how comfortable your designs are to use in different environments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a design to &ldquo;feel right&rdquo;, it must be comfortable to use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-09-03 at 09.41.21\" src=\"https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-03-at-09.41.21-520x373.png\" style=\"height:373px; width:520px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Photo Credit:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/rosenfeldmedia/7171779486/in/photolist-bVKfbs-7ijKGV\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Rosenfeld Media</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Creative Commons 2.0</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2013/02/how-do-users-really-hold-mobile-devices.php\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Thumb patterns</a>&nbsp;on mobile devices need to be reachable and accessible.

Connect Emotionally</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Focus on the one emotion your project should convey. Don&rsquo;t get wrapped up in trying to create multiple emotional experiences. Do one exceptionally well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The emotional connection is two-pronged:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Your design should create a relationship between users and your product.</li>\r\n	<li>Your design should create relationships between users.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-09-03 at 09.42.18\" src=\"https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-03-at-09.42.18.png\" style=\"height:394px; width:396px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a variety of ways to create an emotional connection with your users. As outlined in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.uxpin.com/visual-web-ui-design-colors-space-contrast.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Web UI Design for the Human Eye</a>, color is a good way to stir emotions in people. Contrast, complementary colors and vibrancy all tug at the heartstrings in different ways. Colors evoke different moods in people as well. For example:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong><strong>Red:&nbsp;</strong>Conjures up passion, and gets the blood pumping with excitement.&nbsp;</strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong>Orange:&nbsp;</strong>Gives a whimsy lightheartedness to a design.&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Green:&nbsp;</strong>Promote prosperity, both physically and financially.&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Purple:&nbsp;</strong>Conveys the lap of luxury.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-09-03 at 09.43.26\" src=\"https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-03-at-09.43.26-520x340.png\" style=\"height:340px; width:520px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Photo credit:&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://www.feltapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Felt App</em></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But color is but one aspect that goes into nurturing an emotional bond. Copywriting and visuals also play a role.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.feltapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Felt App</a>&rsquo;s marketing site has light copy with a conversational tone. The photos are all moments that one might experience in life &mdash;&nbsp;mementos of the past. The colors are earth tone, mostly browns with a splash of red from the one envelope. All of these elements alone don&rsquo;t add up to an emotion, but together these all craft the feeling of nostalgia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emotional connections are established in a variety of ways. Brand loyalty, for example, stems from emotional connection. The type of emotion is determined by the tone, message and design choices you make. For example, a photo of people crying can cause concern for users &ndash; why are the people in the photo upset and how can they be helped?</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><strong>4. Design with Mental Triggers</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Understanding a little human psychology goes a long way when it comes to design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But you don&rsquo;t have to enroll in college again to use those tools. Spencer Lanoue broke down &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.usertesting.com/blog/2015/05/12/6-psychological-triggers-that-make-ux-design-persuasive/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;Psychological Triggers That Make UX Design Persuasive</a>&rdquo; from an academic research standpoint for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-09-03 at 09.44.21\" src=\"https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-03-at-09.44.21-520x339.png\" style=\"height:339px; width:520px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Photo credit:&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://event.larepenger.no/en/en/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Laerepenger</em></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what the concepts look like (and how they relate to design):</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Do something for other people.</strong>&nbsp;And they will return the favor. Look at the example above, take the quiz and you can save money.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>People look at the behavior of others</strong>. Especially when they are not sure how to act. Include a social stream in your design to make users feel like part of a bigger group.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Users want what they can&rsquo;t have.</strong>&nbsp;The scarcity principle is why limited-time deals work so effectively.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Users tend to fall in the middle when it comes to making choices</strong>. Most people will be drawn to the center. As recommended by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hick%27s_law\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hick&rsquo;s Law</a>, more choices leads to decision paralysis, so choose carefully.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>People are drawn to what is relevant to them right now.</strong>&nbsp;Consider beacons, notifications or check in tools to be in the moment.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>People remember elements that stand out.</strong>&nbsp;Use contrast to create focus.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>People require timely feedback</strong>. Know the &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.nngroup.com/articles/powers-of-10-time-scales-in-ux/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Power of 10</a>&rdquo; when it comes to interaction design. As Jakob Nielsen stated, users need feedback within 0.1 seconds to feel like they still control the experience. If it takes longer than 1 second for your interface to respond, the feeling of control quickly disintegrates. Whether the feedback is purely visual or text-based (like a modal window), make sure it&rsquo;s clearly understood and uses a conversational tone.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-09-03 at 09.45.24\" src=\"https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-03-at-09.45.24-520x338.png\" style=\"height:338px; width:520px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Photo credit:&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://special.bose.eu/en/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Bose</em></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://special.bose.eu/en/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bose</a>&nbsp;is a good example. The site takes a few seconds to load, but the smooth loading animations makes the wait feel less tedious. As you hover over each product, the smoothly triggered animations makes the user feel like they&rsquo;re playfully browsing through a rolodex. The interface also features contrasting bars of colors to capture the user&rsquo;s attention, drawing them immediately to the products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take a look at the animated prototype we built below in&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uxpin.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">UXPin</a>. Notice how the menu loads immediately after tapping, but transitions a bit slower (so that it&rsquo;s not jarring).

Design With Simplicity</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p>A wise man once said, &ldquo;the design is in the details.&rdquo; Simplicity always strengthens the details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Websites such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram thrive on this human factor. People are sharing their lives with other people. The design and interface is simply the vehicle that gets them there. Now think about the designs of each of these websites. All of these platforms started with simple tools for sharing and while they have grown in complexity over the years, the core usability is still easy to learn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-09-03 at 09.48.03\" src=\"https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-03-at-09.48.03-520x338.png\" style=\"height:338px; width:520px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Photo credit:&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://tour.sydney.edu.au/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The University of Sydney</em></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Start with simple visual elements:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Color:&nbsp;</strong>Stick to one or two colors that are high in contrast. Keep&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2012/06/color-and-cultural-design-considerations/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cultural considerations</a>&nbsp;in mind, especially if your website is designed for an international audience.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Typography:&nbsp;</strong>The first rule of typography is that it must be legible (letters are easy to discern) and readable (words and sentences are easy to understand). All main body copy should be set at a level that is comfortable for the eye. Start with a sans serif style and include plenty of space between lines. For the best visual comfort, consider size and the number of characters per line.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Space:&nbsp;</strong>More space makes a design feel open and inviting. Cramped lettering or elements that are too close together feel chaotic and jarring. It&rsquo;s a tricky balance though, because wide open spaces can sometimes create the feeling that something is missing. A good approach is to subtract elements from your design until it breaks, then working your way back over the threshold.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Micro-interactions:</strong>&nbsp;Design interactions and notifications work in an almost invisible way. Like a simple hover animation, they add visual polish while giving users instant feedback. Follow the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.howdesign.com/web-design-resources-technology/12-basic-principles-animation-motion-design/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">12 principles of animation</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Prototyping your design is a good way to see if these visual elements work or not. While doing so, look for where you can trim because as the old adage goes, &ldquo;less is more.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><strong>Takeaways</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Designs with a human touch just feel right. It might be intangible, but it&rsquo;s undeniably powerful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Think of interactions between people. Most communication happens using common languages, such as speech or even posture or gestures. It&rsquo;s usable communication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s the very same thing when it comes to designing a website or app. The most stripped-down purpose is to communicate something with users. Creating a simple, easy-to-understand method for this communication is always the quickest route to success.</p>\r\n', 'Yudha', 1577715450, 1577715450, 53, 16, '99584435ef0594b5c4601e4e43d9bab7.jpg'),
(10, 'Why White Space Is Crucial To UX Design', '5', 'White space isn’t just about aesthetics, it’s the key to successful user interfaces. Here’s how it really works.', '<p style=\"text-align:justify\">All good visual artists understand the importance of negative space, the empty area that draws attention to, and accentuates, the actual subject. Negative space (the artistic equivalent of a designer&rsquo;s white space) is like the supporting cast whose duty is to make the star of the show stand out more by not standing out so much themselves. If you don&rsquo;t think any part of your design should be intentionally blank, take a look at the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theworldsworstwebsiteever.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">World&rsquo;s Worst Website Eve</a>r for an extreme example of the damage caused by too many objects competing for attention. In interaction design, white space isn&rsquo;t just an aesthetic choice&mdash; it serves three essential functions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><q>White space has been proven to increase comprehension up to 20%.</q></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>1. Improving Comprehension</strong><br />\r\nIf cluttering your interface overloads your user with too much information, then reducing the clutter will improve comprehension. In fact, properly using white space between paragraphs and in the left and right margins has been proven to increase comprehension up to 20%, as pointed out by Dmitry Fadeyev, creator of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.usaura.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Usaura</a>. The skill of using white space lies in providing your users with a digestible amount of content, then stripping away extraneous details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">White space can be broken down into four elements: visual white space (space surrounding graphics, icons, and images); layout white space (margins, paddings, and gutters); text white space (spacing between lines and spacing between letters); and content white space (space separating columns of text).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto/fc/3046656-inline-i-2-why-white-space-is-crucial-in-ux-design.jpg\" style=\"height:200px; width:469px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Medium</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Medium</a>&nbsp;is a great example of striking a nice balance with all four elements of white space. First, think about the goal of the user from an interaction standpoint: users want to access interesting content as quickly as possible. The homepage immediately facilitates that goal by placing content front and center, with plenty of white space on either side to add emphasis. There is ample space around visuals and between lines of copy, although the padding around images could be more uniform (notice how the space to the left of each image is not consistent with space below).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><q>White space helps create mental maps.</q></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Beyond improving comprehension, white space also helps create mental maps. Minimal white space is used between the top navigation and content stream, since both serve similar functions in driving the user deeper into content (and similar functions should be grouped together). Because the right-side navigation focuses more on creating and saving content, more white space separates it from the content stream. In this case, white space helps users assign different functionalities to different parts of the interface. Once users click through to an article, white space helps them focus on what they care about most: the content. Notice how the extra spacing between each line of text improves readability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><q>The Law of Proximity states that images near to each other appear similar.</q></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">To learn more about white space, check out Smashing Magazine&rsquo;s listing of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/01/12/white-space-and-simplicity-an-overview/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">22 expert pieces</a>&nbsp;and take a peek at these&nbsp;<a href=\"http://webdesignledger.com/inspiration/21-inspiring-examples-of-white-space-in-web-design\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">21 inspiring examples</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>2. Clarifying Relationships</strong><br />\r\nWhen observing how individuals organize visual information, Gestalt psychologists stumbled on what they call the Law of Proximity, which states that images near to each other appear similar. For example, take a look at this picture:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto/fc/3046656-inline-i-1-why-white-space-is-crucial-in-ux-design.jpg\" style=\"height:350px; width:527px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><a href=\"http://www.uxpin.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">UXPIN</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Almost everyone sees two groups of dots, rather than simply 20 dots. The dots are all identical and the only thing differentiating them is the white space that separates them. This behavioral observation has&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nngroup.com/articles/form-design-white-space/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">several important applications</a>&nbsp;to interaction design, especially with regards to input forms. Here are two to remember:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Place labels closest to the relevant fields.</em>&nbsp;Information is communicated far more clearly when labels are placed closer to the fields they relate to. As described in our ebook&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uxpin.com/web-ui-design-best-practices.html?utm_source=Interaction%20Design%20Best%20Practices%20V1&amp;utm_medium=ebook&amp;utm_campaign=Interaction%20Design%20Best%20Practices%20V1\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Web UI Best Practices</a>, research has shown that even the slightest hesitation can hurt form completion. In this case, merely adjusting the spacing increases the user&rsquo;s confidence in filling out the form, which of course improves completion rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Group related topics together.&nbsp;</em>When dealing with long forms, the task of filling them out can seem so overwhelming, some users will quit before even trying. Breaking the information up into appropriate groups can help make it feel more manageable. In the form on the right, just categorizing the 15 fields into three groups makes the process feel easier. The amount of content is the same, but the impression on users is much different. Form fields usually present the most friction to users, but the same principles can also apply to navigation and site content. Instead of a top navigation menu with 20 items, you can create a dropdown menu with four to seven top-level items and the rest categorized under submenus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>3. Attracting Attention.&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\nAs we noted above, the lack of other elements will only make existing elements stand out more. Our redesign for Yelp is a case in point. In the high-fidelity prototype, we added plenty of white space to separate the categories from the search function. In doing so, the category icons are much more noticeable (and less cluttered than their current vertical format). Combined with an animation-like color fill that&rsquo;s triggered on hover, the category section now attracts even more attention while providing better feedback to the user. But because humans have a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nngroup.com/articles/tunnel-vision-and-selective-attention/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">selective attention</a>&nbsp;that leads to tunnel vision&mdash;like tuning out banner ads, known as &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.nngroup.com/articles/banner-blindness-old-and-new-findings/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">banner blindness</a>&ldquo;&mdash;you also need to know when spacing between content should be reduced and altered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><q>The power of white space comes from the limits of human attention and memory</q></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Ultimately, you need to understand that the power of white space comes from the limits of human attention and memory. Just compare the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Yahoo</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.pt/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a>&nbsp;interfaces. Yahoo tries to get the user to consider too many actions at once. Google understands the bottom line that people just want to use search engines to find stuff. By being realistic about the user goal, Google&rsquo;s design encourages more effective interaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Most designers subscribe to the &ldquo;don&rsquo;t make the user think&rdquo; school of thought. It&rsquo;s not that users are just lazy, it&rsquo;s that they already have a lot on their mind, and cramming extra information just makes it harder to complete their tasks. The amount of strain an interface design creates is called &ldquo;<a href=\"http://shortboredsurfer.com/2010/08/11-principles-of-interaction-design-explained/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cognitive load</a>.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto/fc/3046656-inline-i-3-why-white-space-is-crucial-in-ux-design.png\" style=\"height:450px; width:743px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Etsy</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Over the years, designers have developed strategies for minimizing cognitive load without sacrificing features. As complicated as the human brain is, its shortcomings are surprisingly predictable. In 1956, scientist George Miller released his findings that our short-term memory can usually retain data of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/chunking.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">between five and nine items</a>&mdash;an average of seven&mdash;before forgetfulness sinks in. While the exact number has been contested (three to six items is the current ideal), Miller&rsquo;s findings have proven effective and led to important IxD methods, including so-called &ldquo;chunking,&rdquo; the practice of grouping relevant information together to make it easier to process and remember.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Reducing cognitive load will make the UI not only more usable but also more enjoyable to use, and it&rsquo;s white space that will help creating this sense of harmony and fluidity throughout the user&rsquo;s experience.</p>\r\n', 'Yudha', 1577715538, 1577715538, 56, 15, 'dd56567ac80b3429b988e806e91c0cfb.jpg'),

But what exact purposes do push notifications serve?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Push notifications keep users informed about important updates. Moreover, they remind users of your app&rsquo;s existence and tend to improve retention metrics. Whether your app is running in the background or is inactive, sending a push notification will ensure that relevant information is delivered on time, providing value for users and convertible actions for product owners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Keep in mind that on Android, push notifications are received by default. On iOS, they&rsquo;re blocked by default. For this reason, iOS and Android users treat pushes differently. Compared to Android users, iOS users are less likely to open a notification. However, if they do so, they do it much faster than Android users. We suggest considering the differences between these two mobile platforms when planning your approach to push notifications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">How do push notifications work? What are the technologies standing behind the push notification mechanisms? We wrote this post to answer these questions by breaking down the push technology and to address the issues a developer should keep in mind when building push notification features.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\">Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)</h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In 2014, Google acquired Firebase. Subsequently, they replaced Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) with Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), announcing it to be the successor of GCM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">FCM provides new functionality:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">- An intuitive notifications interface in the Firebase console<br />\r\n- Improved reporting<br />\r\n- Native integrations with other Firebase products including A/B Testing (to find out which message brings more conversions) and Predictions (to tailor notifications to people based on their expected behavior)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">FCM helps you inform a client app that incoming data (e.g. a new message) is ready to sync. In the case of instant messaging, a message can transmit a payload not exceeding 4KB.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">To implement FCM, you&rsquo;ll need two key components:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">1. A trusted environment like Cloud Functions for Firebase or an app server that allows you to create, target, and forward messages<br />\r\n2. An iOS or Android client application for accepting messages</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Messages can be sent by means of the Firebase Admin SDK or the FCM server protocols. The notifications composer is used for testing and sending messages. It provides built-in targeting and analytics. FCM helps you send notifications and messages to iOS and Android free of charge.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\">Registering with FCM</h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">FCM lets you forward pushes directly from the Firebase console, with an app server or other trusted environment supporting the server logic. Devices exchange pushes with the help of a notification key by sending notifications to the server. This ensures synchronization of actions, such as alerts, across multiple mobile devices. But to do that, the app needs to register with FCM first:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">1. The client app transmits the sender ID, API Key, and App ID to FCM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">2. FCM returns a registration token to the client app.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">3. The client app then sends the registration token to the app server.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"Client-app-registration-with-FCM\" src=\"https://yalantis.com//uploads/ckeditor/pictures/3281/content_Client_app_registration_with_FCM.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>[Client app registration with FCM]</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Note: To use FCM, in addition to implementing it in the mobile app, you&rsquo;ll have to implement it on the server side. Also, you&rsquo;ll have to implement the sending of a device&rsquo;s registration_id from the mobile app to the server.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\">Notification channels</h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Beginning in Android 8.0 (API level 26), all pushes have to be assigned to a channel. It&rsquo;s possible to set the visual and auditory behavior applied to all pushes in a channel. Users can change these settings and choose which notification channels from your application will have the highest priority.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Note that after you make a notification channel, you aren&rsquo;t able to change the behavior of notifications. Only the user is allowed to do that. However, you can change the channel&rsquo;s name and description. Keep in mind that you should make different channels for all types of pushes you want to forward. In addition, you can set up different notification channels for all conversation groups a user creates in a messaging app.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"Push-notification-settings-for-the-Clock-app-and-one-of-its-channels\" src=\"https://yalantis.com//uploads/ckeditor/pictures/3282/content_Push_notification_settings_for_the_Clock_app_and_one_of_its_channels.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>[Push notification settings for the Clock app and one of its channels]</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\">Push notifications behavior</h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The behavior of Firebase notifications depends on the foreground/background state of the receiving application. You can learn about receiving messages in an Android app&nbsp;<a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/receive\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Keep in mind that push notification behavior also depends on devices. For example, push notifications not coming through is a common issue on Xiaomi phones unless notifications are manually whitelisted in the device&rsquo;s settings.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\">Alternative push notification services (for both iOS &amp; Android)</h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">There are other services that either extend the possibilities of FCM or offer their own custom solutions that don&rsquo;t rely on Google Play Services. Two of these alternatives are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sailthru.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Sailthru&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.airship.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Airship</a>. Their advantage is that they can be used cross-platform. However, the functionality they provide can be too extensive for some basic use cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Read also:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://yalantis.com/blog/list-of-best-frameworks-for-android-app-development/\" target=\"_blank\">Best Frameworks, Libraries, and SDKs That Can Help Develop Android Apps</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\">Push notifications on iOS</h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In the latest iOS versions, the number of features related to pushes has grown considerably. Currently, iOS lets you:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">- Determine your own actions<br />\r\n- Change the content of pushes before displaying them<br />\r\n- Show push notifications in a custom interface</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align:justify\">Apple push notifications architecture tutorial</h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"Apple-push-notifications-architecture\" src=\"https://yalantis.com//uploads/ckeditor/pictures/3283/content_Apple_push_notifications_architecture.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">How can you add push notifications to an iOS app? Follow these steps:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">1. iOS requests a device token from Apple Push Notification Service (APNS).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">2. The app receives the token, which functions as the address to send a push notification to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">3. The app sends the token of the device to your server.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">4. When prompted, the server will send a push notification with a device token to the APNS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">5. APNS will send a push notification to the user&rsquo;s device.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">What must you do to enable push notifications for iOS? First, you need to create a provisioning profile and an SSL certificate. Push notifications are always sent by your own server. You need to launch the background implementation on this server, install an SSL certificate, and set up an outgoing TLS connection on certain ports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Check out:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://yalantis.com/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-develop-an-app/\" target=\"_blank\">App Development Cost</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align:justify\">Badge handling</h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">A badge is a little red circle in the top right corner of your iOS app icon that tells the user when there is new information waiting to be read (messages, news, events, missed calls, etc.) A badge also indicates the number of unread messages or notifications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Note: The Android Oreo operating system implemented notification badges and notification previews allowing users to check unread messages, emails, and missed calls. In Oreo, users can see just a small dot and don&rsquo;t see the actual number of unread notifications. Android launchers such as Evie Launcher, Microsoft Launcher, and One Launcher will help you customize the badge style or change its color and size.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">However, there&rsquo;s one problem with badge notifications: the number indicated on the badge may not coincide with the number of messages inside the app. For example, the badge on your app&rsquo;s icon may show two unread messages, but when you open the app there are five.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">This is confusing for users. It&rsquo;s especially irritating, however, when a badge shows a new message that doesn&rsquo;t exist in the app. And users can&rsquo;t manually clear message counts unless you specifically build that functionality into your app. To keep your users sane, bind the number of incoming messages with the badge count. Don&rsquo;t let them live separate lives!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align:justify\">The server&rsquo;s role in the badge count</h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">It&rsquo;s not just iOS developers who are responsible for badge counts. Badge counts come from the server. Apps typically have unread notification counts that are maintained on the server for each user. When the server sends a push notification to a particular device, it sends the badge count along with the payload.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Once a device receives a push notification, iOS automatically sets the badge count on the app icon to the specified value. So this value should always be up to date on the server. Remember to inform the server when a message has been read so that it can reduce the badge count. It&rsquo;s a simple process:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">- Locally update the badge counter<br />\r\n- Notify the server that the information was read by sending a request</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align:justify\">Request sent to the server fails to be delivered</h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">When a user reads new messages, the badge count on the app&rsquo;s icon is updated locally and a request is sent to the server to update the badge count. This is great &mdash; unless the request fails to be delivered to the server due to a poor internet connection or some other factor. If a request fails, the server will be unaware of the status of the message and the badge count won&rsquo;t be updated. The next time a push arrives, the local data won&rsquo;t correspond to the icon count sent in the push. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">A developer should always guarantee the delivery of the request to the server. But how? One option would be to save the updated value of the badge counter locally, and in case of delivery failure, resend it at the next opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Note: Remember that a device, not a user, subscribes for push notifications. This means that if a user logs out of an app to let somebody else log in on the same device, this device should unsubscribe from push notifications to avoid the nuisance of receiving somebody else&rsquo;s pushes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align:justify\">Mind user permission requests</h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">You need access to a user&rsquo;s device to be able to send them notifications, but you need permission for that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The way your users encounter this permission request is crucial for your app. The challenge for iOS app developers is that iOS lets you ask for a user&rsquo;s permission only once. If they decline, the user has to find out how to turn the permission back on in the iOS settings.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align:justify\">Explain</h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">We can explain why we need the user to subscribe for push notifications before the request for permission shows up on the screen. This explanatory window can stress the importance of push notifications and draw attention to how the app&rsquo;s functionality will be limited without them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Cheat</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">We can outwit the system. How? We can send users permission request pop-ups with options that are more appealing. For example, we might display the options &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;Later.&rdquo; If the user pushes &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; they&rsquo;ll then have to confirm that choice again by pushing &ldquo;OK&rdquo; in the system window. Asking two times for the same thing isn&rsquo;t the best solution, but it works!</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In other cases, a user may push &ldquo;Later.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s not what we want, but at least we can show the same dialog again every time they open the app until they finally press &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Popular apps such as Circa and Breaking News have borrowed this hack. The Breaking News app shows a mock push. Circa encourages users to accept pushes by explaining the benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"Requesting-the-ability-to-send-notifications-in-the-Circa-and-Breaking-Newsapps\" src=\"https://yalantis.com//uploads/ckeditor/pictures/3284/content_Requesting_the_ability_to_send_notifications_in_the_Circa_and_Breaking_News_apps.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>[Requesting the ability to send notifications in the Circa and Breaking News apps]</em></p>\r\n', 'Yudha', 1577715641, 1579187293, 57, 14, 'f3332c4d32b3d1190926ea1c22ef62c1.jpg');
